# Enhanced Commit Message Generator Examples

This document demonstrates the improved commit message generation inspired by Claude's patterns.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Intelligent Change Analysis**
- Deep semantic analysis of code changes
- Context-aware description generation
- Impact assessment and prioritization

### 2. **Claude-Style Messaging**
- Action-oriented, specific descriptions
- Multi-line detailed bodies with bullet points
- Contextual reasoning and impact explanations

### 3. **Enhanced Descriptions**
- "improve" instead of "update" for better clarity
- Specific action verbs based on change type
- Integration of change context and purpose

## Example Transformations

### Before (Old Generator):
```
feat: enhance generator functionality
```

### After (Claude-Inspired Generator):
```
refactor: improve CLI help output and banner consistency

- Streamline fcgh help text and remove redundant instructions
- Improve command descriptions for better clarity
- Remove validation error exit to allow informational usage
- Ensure consistent banner separator usage across all modules
- Focus help output on essential information only

These changes make the CLI more user-friendly and consistent across the application.
```

## Features Demonstrated

### Multiple File Changes
When multiple files are changed, the generator now:
- Groups changes by type and scope
- Provides detailed bullet points for each change
- Explains the overall impact of the changes

### Single File Complex Changes
For complex changes to a single file:
- Lists specific improvements made
- Explains the reasoning behind changes
- Describes the expected impact

### Context Integration
The generator now understands context like:
- Error handling improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Security enhancements
- User experience improvements

## Technical Implementation

### Intelligent Analysis Components:
1. **Semantic Analysis**: Understanding what the code does
2. **Impact Assessment**: Determining the significance of changes
3. **Context Detection**: Understanding why changes were made
4. **Description Enhancement**: Creating clear, action-oriented descriptions

### Claude-Style Message Structure:
1. **Subject Line**: Clear, specific, action-oriented
2. **Detailed Body**: Bullet points with specific improvements
3. **Impact Statement**: Explanation of overall benefit

This enhanced generator produces commit messages that are more informative, professional, and follow the patterns demonstrated by Claude's excellent commit message generation.
