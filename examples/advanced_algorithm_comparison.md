# Advanced Git Analysis Algorithm Implementation

## Algorithm Comparison: Before vs After

### **Previous Basic Algorithm** ❌

```bash
# Limited analysis approach
git status --porcelain        # Get basic file status
git add .                     # Stage everything
git diff --staged             # Get simple diff content
```

**Limitations:**
- No statistical information about changes
- No file-level change type detection (A/M/D)
- No historical context or pattern learning
- No word-level granular analysis
- Basic heuristic-based type detection

### **New Comprehensive Algorithm** ✅

```bash
# Comprehensive analysis following your specification
git diff --stat HEAD~1 HEAD           # Line count statistics per file
git diff --name-status HEAD~1 HEAD    # File change types (A/M/D)  
git diff --word-diff HEAD~1 HEAD      # Word-level granular changes
git log --oneline -10                 # Recent commit patterns for style
git diff --staged                     # Staged content (compatibility)
```

**Enhancements:**
- ✅ Statistical analysis with precise line counts
- ✅ Proper change type classification (Added/Modified/Deleted)
- ✅ Repository style pattern learning
- ✅ Word-level change detection for context
- ✅ Adaptive message generation based on repo history

## Implementation Details

### **Step 1: File Statistics (`git diff --stat`)**
```go
// Example output parsing:
// pkg/ccgen/analyzer.go     | 45 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
// cmd/cc/main.go           | 12 +++++++---
// README.md                |  8 +++++++

FileStatistics{
    Filename: "pkg/ccgen/analyzer.go",
    Additions: 38,     // Calculated from + symbols
    Deletions: 7,      // Calculated from - symbols  
    ChangeType: "M"    // Set in step 2
}
```

### **Step 2: Change Types (`git diff --name-status`)**
```go
// Example output parsing:
// M    pkg/ccgen/analyzer.go
// A    pkg/ccgen/advanced_analyzer.go  
// D    old_file.go

// Results in precise change type classification:
// "A" = Added file   → feat
// "M" = Modified     → Analyzed by content + ratios
// "D" = Deleted      → refactor
```

### **Step 3: Word-Level Analysis (`git diff --word-diff`)**
```go
// Detects specific context from word changes:
// {+error+} handling  → "improve error handling"
// {+optimize+} code   → "enhance performance"  
// {+test+} coverage   → "improve test coverage"
```

### **Step 4: Pattern Learning (`git log --oneline -10`)**
```go
CommitPatterns{
    CommonTypes: {"feat": 5, "fix": 3, "docs": 2},
    PreferredStyle: "conventional",  // vs "freeform"
    AverageLength: 65,               // Characters
}

// Adapts message style:
// - Conventional repos → "feat(scope): description"
// - Freeform repos     → "Simple description"
// - Length targeting   → Matches repo average
```

## Output Comparison Examples

### **Basic Algorithm Output** (Before):
```

# Generated message with Claude-style intelligence:
feat(ccgen): implement comprehensive git analysis algorithm

- Add advanced statistical analysis with line count tracking
- Implement change type detection using git name-status
- Add word-level diff analysis for precise context detection  
- Integrate repository style pattern learning from commit history
- Enhance commit generation with adaptive formatting

These changes significantly improve commit message intelligence by
providing comprehensive git repository analysis capabilities.
```

## Key Algorithm Improvements

### **1. Statistical Intelligence**
- Precise line counts per file
- Addition/deletion ratios for change classification
- Impact assessment based on change magnitude

### **2. Change Type Precision**
- Direct git change type detection (A/M/D)
- No more heuristic guessing
- Accurate classification of file operations

### **3. Historical Context**
- Learns from recent commit patterns
- Adapts to repository style preferences
- Maintains consistency with existing practices

### **4. Word-Level Granularity**
- Detects specific improvements (error handling, performance)
- Context-aware description enhancement
- Semantic understanding of changes

### **5. Adaptive Generation**
- Repository-specific style matching
- Length optimization based on history
- Conventional vs freeform format detection

This implementation transforms the commit message generator from a basic diff parser into a sophisticated git analysis engine that understands repository context, change patterns, and generates truly intelligent commit messages.
